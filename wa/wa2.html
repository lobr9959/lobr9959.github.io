        My name is <em>Logan Brown</em>, I use <em>he/him</em> pronouns and I'm a senior in computer science finishing my minor in CTD this semester. 
        I hope to create a unique portfolio page that reflects my style and be confident in more front end skills, specifically writing my own CSS style sheets. 
        I produce music and like to work in creative environments, recently I have been active in ROAM, the campus fashion magazine.
