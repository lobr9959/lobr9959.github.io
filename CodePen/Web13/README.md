# interactive hungry bear

A Pen created on CodePen.

I experimented with CSS border-image in this pen - it's used to style the bear and also to add the effects (the sparkle and crumbs from the donuts). The bear will continue to grow bigger as you feed her more donuts, and the style adapts automatically thanks to border-image.
